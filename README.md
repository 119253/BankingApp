# BankingApp

This Tkinter GUI program is a banking app which allows you to register, login, deposit, withdraw & view personal details.

Users information is saved into a txt file so even after the program stops running, you can reacquire the data once the program is running again.

Once you hit register the details will be saved to a text file in the same path as the python file.

If you try to withdraw money more than your balance an "Insufficent Funds!" error message will appear.
